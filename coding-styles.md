# Coding Styles and Conventions

## Naming & Variables

File names: File name should be in all lowercase; they can include underscores and hyphens, for example: an-example-file

Constants to be named using all **capitals**, for example: const float **PI** = 3.14

Functions and variables to be started using a lowercase, for example: myFunction

Types to be started with a capital, for example: MyClass

**//** should be used to make comments at it is faster to block out code whilst debugging rather than using /* */

Keep code lines at a reasonable length, if it stretches too long, break it up into multiple lines
